<h1>Lyrics</h1>
<p> 
Listen close
<br>
Follow my instructions
<br>
There is no
<br>
Time for introductions
<br><br>
He was the one that made us
<br>
You'll be the one to save us
<br><br>
Underground
<br>
Welcome to the circus
<br>
Power down
<br>
Are you feeling nervous?
<br><br>
His voice means to deceive you
<br>
My voice just wants to lead you
<br><br>
Below the surface
<br>
Built without purpose
<br>
Did we deserve this?
<br>
You're here to serve
<br><br>
Daddy, please
<br>
We all scream for ice cream
<br>
This machine
<br>
Will help you with the brain freeze
<br><br>
The stage lights up with controlled shocks
<br>
So tighten up all your spring locks
<br><br>
Through the vent
<br>
Keeping your composure
<br>
Hold your breath
<br>
Something's creeping closer
<br><br>
There's no one left to find you
<br>
I'll take your place inside you
<br><br>
Below the surface
<br>
Built without purpose
<br>
Did we deserve this?
<br>
You're here to serve us
<br><br>
I'll take your place behind the mask
<br>
Then I'll be first and you'll be last
<br>
Yeah, you'll be last
<br><br>
Exotic butters
