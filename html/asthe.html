                <p>
                    My feet are aching<br>
                    And your back is pretty tired<br>
                    And we've drunk a couple bottles, babe<br>
                    And set our grief aside<br>
                    The papers say it's doomsday<br>
                    The button has been pressed<br>
                    We're gonna nuke each other up, boys<br>
                    'Til old Satan stands impressed<br><br>
                    And here it is, our final night alive<br>
                    And as the earth burns to the ground<br><br>
                    Oh, girl, it's you that I lie with<br>
                    As the atom bomb locks in<br>
                    Oh, it's you I watch TV with<br>
                    As the world, as the world caves in<br><br>
                    You put your final suit on<br>
                    I paint my fingernails<br>
                    Oh, we're going out in style, babe<br>
                    And everything's on sale<br>
                    We creep up on extinction<br>
                    I pull your arms right in<br>
                    I weep and say, "Goodnight, love"<br>
                    While my organs pack it in<br><br>
                    And here it is, our final night alive<br>
                    And as the earth burns to the ground<br><br>
                    Oh, girl, it's you that I lie with<br>
                    As the atom bomb locks in<br>
                    Oh, it's you I watch TV with<br>
                    As the world, as the world caves<br><br>
                    Oh, it's you that I lie with<br>
                    As the atom bomb locks in<br>
                    Yes, it's you I welcome death with<br>
                    As the world, as the world caves in<br><br>
                    As the world caves in<br>
