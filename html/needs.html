                    Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself<br>
                    Just leave me for somebody else<br>
                    Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself<br>
                    Just leave me for somebody else<br>
                    Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself<br>
                    Just leave me for somebody else<br>
                    Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself<br>
                    Just leave me for somebody else<br>
                    Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself<br>
                    She doesn't need nobody else<br>
                    Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself<br>
                    She doesn't need nobody else<br><br>
                    What's your name, let me out please<br>
                    You know I love you, you're my darling<br>
                    Don't stop, baby, don't, please<br>
                    For my enemies, don't unleash<br>
                    And I'll be sitting on the throne now<br>
                    As I'm dying<br>
                    I'll be thinking about your face now<br>
                    When I can't remember all days now<br>
                    All days that we've been trying to forget about<br>
                    How<br><br>
                    Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself<br>
                    I can tell that you don't love nobody but yourself<br>
                    Please don't put me on a shelf<br>
                    I can love you, I help can you feel the way you felt<br><br>
                    I think you're wrong and you think you're right<br>
                    About these letters that you said you were at his house tonight<br>
                    You never get me but I understand, I think it's fine<br>
                    I lost your number and I don't expect you hitting mine<br>
