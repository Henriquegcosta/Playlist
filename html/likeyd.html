                <h1>Lyrics</h1>
                <p>
                    Lately<br>
                    I can't help but think that our roads might take us down different phases<br>
                    Don't wanna complicate the rhythm that we got but I'm speechless<br>
                    When everything's so pure, can it be aimless?<br>
                    Painless?<br><br>
                    If you ever go<br>
                    All the songs that we like<br>
                    Will sound like bittersweet lullabies<br><br>
                    Lost in the blue<br>
                    They don't love me like you do<br>
                    Those chills that I knew<br>
                    They were nothing without you<br>
                    And everyone else<br>
                    They don't matter now<br>
                    You're the one I can't lose<br>
                    No one loves me like you do<br><br>
                    Since I met you<br>
                    All the gloomy days just seem to shine a little more brightly<br>
                    Consider what we've got 'cause I can never take you for granted<br>
                    Is there another us on this whole planet?<br>
                    Planet?<br><br>
                    If you ever go<br>
                    All the songs that we like<br>
                    Will sound like bittersweet lullabies<br><br>
                    Lost in the blue<br>
                    They don't love me like you do<br>
                    Those chills that I knew<br>
                    They were nothing without you<br>
                    And everyone else<br>
                    They don't matter now<br>
                    You're the one I can't lose<br>
                    No one loves me like you do<br>
                    No one loves me like you do<br><br>
                    I don't wanna seem foolish<br>
                    When I'm jumping into this<br>
                    You're all that I see<br><br>
                    Lost in the blue<br>
                    They don't love me like you do<br>
                    Those chills that I knew<br>
                    They were nothing without you<br>
                    And everyone else<br>
                    They don't matter now<br>
                    You're the one I can't lose<br>
                    No one loves me like you do<br>
                    No one loves me like you do<br>
