                <p>
                    Look out for yourself<br><br>
                    I wake up to the sounds of the silence that allows<br>
                    For my mind to run around with my ear up to the ground<br>
                    I'm searching to behold the stories that are told<br>
                    When my back is to the world that was smiling when I turned<br><br>
                    Tell you, you're the greatest<br>
                    But once you turn, they hate us<br><br>
                    Oh, the misery<br>
                    Everybody wants to be my enemy<br>
                    Spare the sympathy<br>
                    Everybody wants to be my enemy<br><br>
                    Look out for yourself<br>
                    My enemy<br><br>
                    Look out for yourself<br>
                    But I'm ready<br><br>
                    Your words up on the wall as you're praying for my fall<br>
                    And the laughter in the halls<br>
                    And the names that I've been called<br>
                    I stack it in my mind and I'm waiting for the time<br>
                    When I show you what it's like to be words spit in a mic<br><br>
                    Tell you, you're the greatest<br>
                    But once you turn, they hate us (ha)<br><br>
                    Oh, the misery<br>
                    Everybody wants to be my enemy<br>
                    Spare the sympathy<br>
                    Everybody wants to be my enemy<br><br>
                    Look out for yourself<br>
                    My enemy (yeah)<br><br>
                    Look out for yourself<br><br>
                    Uh, look, okay<br>
                    I'm hoping that somebody pray for me<br>
                    I'm praying that somebody hope for me<br>
                    I'm staying where nobody 'posed to be<br>
                    Posted, being a wreck of emotions<br>
                    Ready to go whenever, just let me know<br>
                    The road is long, so put the pedal into the floor<br>
                    The enemy on my trail, my energy unavailable<br>
                    I'ma tell 'em, "Hasta luego"<br>
