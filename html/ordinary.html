                <h1>Lyrics</h1>
                <p>
                    They tell me, "Keep it simple", I tell them, "Take it slow"<br>
                    I feed and water an idea so I let it grow<br>
                    I tell them, "Take it easy", they laugh and tell me, "No"<br>
                    It's cool but I don't see them laughing at my money though<br>
                    They spitting facts at me, I'm spitting tracks, catch me?<br>
                    I'm spinning gold out my records, know you can't combat me<br><br>
                    They tell me, "Jesus walks", I tell them, "Money talks"<br>
                    Bling got me chill, 'cause I'm living in an icebox<br>
                    They tell me I've been sleeping, I say, "I'm wide awake"<br>
                    Tracks hot and ready so they call me Mister Easy-Bake<br>
                    They say the grass is greener, I think my grass is dank<br>
                    Drivin' with a drank on an empty tank to the bank<br><br>
                    Do you feel me? Take a look inside my brain<br>
                    The people always different but it always feels the same<br>
                    That's the real me, pop the champagne<br>
                    The haters wanna hurt me and I'm laughin' at the pain<br><br>
                    Stayin' still, eyes closed<br>
                    Let the world just pass me by<br>
                    Pain pills, nice clothes<br>
                    If I fall, I think I'll fly<br>
                    Touch me, Midas<br>
                    Make me part of your design<br>
                    None to guide us<br>
                    I feel fear for the very last time<br><br>
                    They tell me that I'm special, I smile and shake my head<br>
                    I'll give them stories to tell friends about the things I said<br>
                    They tell me I'm so humble, I say, "I'm turning red"<br>
                    They let me lie to them and don't feel like they've been misled<br>
                    They give so much to me, I'm losing touch, get me?<br>
                    Served on a silver platter, ask for seconds, they just let me<br><br>
                    They tell me I'm a god, I'm lost in the facade<br>
                    Six-feet off the ground at all times, I think I'm feeling odd<br>
                    No matter what I make, they never see mistakes<br>
                    Makin' so much bread, I don't care that they're just being fake<br>
                    They tell me they're below me, I act like I'm above<br>
                    The people blend together but I would be lost without their love<br><br>
                    Can you heal me? Have I gained too much?<br>
                    When you become untouchable, you're unable to touch<br>
                    Is there a real me? Pop the champagne<br>
                    It hurts me just to think and I don't do pain<br><br>
                    Stayin' still, eyes closed<br>
                    Let the world just pass me by<br>
                    Pain pills, nice clothes<br>
                    If I fall, I think I'll fly<br>
                    Touch me, Midas<br>
                    Make me part of your design<br>
                    None to guide us<br>
                    I feel fear for the very last time<br><br>
                    Lay still, restless<br>
                    Losing sleep while I lose my mind<br>
                    All thrill, no stress<br>
                    All my muses left behind (left behind)<br>
                    World is below<br>
                    So high up, I'm near-divine (I'm so high up)<br>
                    Lean in, let go<br>
                    I feel fear for the very last time<br>
