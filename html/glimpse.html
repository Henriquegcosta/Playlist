                <p>
                    She'd take the world off my shoulders<br>
                    If it was ever hard to move<br>
                    She'd turn the rain to a rainbow<br>
                    When I was living in the blue<br>
                    Why then, if she is so perfect<br>
                    Do I still wish that it was you?<br>
                    Perfect don't mean that it's working<br>
                    So what can I do? (Ooh)<br><br>
                    When you're out of sight<br>
                    In my mind<br><br>
                    'Cause sometimes I look in her eyes<br>
                    And that's where I find a glimpse of us<br>
                    And I try to fall for her touch<br>
                    But I'm thinking of the way it was<br>
                    Said I'm fine and said I moved on<br>
                    I'm only here passing time in her arms<br>
                    Hoping I'll find<br>
                    A glimpse of us<br><br>
                    Tell me he savors your glory<br>
                    Does he laugh the way I did?<br>
                    Is this a part of your story?<br>
                    One that I had never lived<br>
                    Maybe one day you'll feel lonely<br>
                    And in his eyes, you'll get a glimpse<br>
                    Maybe you'll start slipping slowly<br>
                    And find me again<br><br>
                    When you're out of sight<br>
                    In my mind<br><br>
                    'Cause sometimes I look in her eyes<br>
                    And that's where I find a glimpse of us<br>
                    And I try to fall for her touch<br>
                    But I'm thinking of the way it was<br>

                    I'm only here passing time in her arms<br>
                    Hoping I'll find<br>
                    A glimpse of us<br><br>
                    Ooh, ooh-ooh<br>
                    Ooh, ooh-ooh<br>
                    Ooh, ooh, ooh<br><br>
                    'Cause sometimes I look in her eyes<br>
