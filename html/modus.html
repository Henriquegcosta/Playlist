                <p>
                    Speed it up, slow it down<br>
                    Need control, need it now<br>
                    I need to live a thousand times<br>
                    I cannot stop, I cannot cry<br>
                    I will not fret, I will not die<br>
                    I am machine, I stay alive<br>
                    Sometimes I think, sometimes I think<br>
                    Sometimes I think, sometimes I (oh)<br><br>
                    I've got no aim, a million rounds, is nothing real<br>
                    A hundred pounds of heavy steel, it feels so loud<br>
                    Tied to my chest, it feels so loud<br>
                    I'll take a peek to across the peaks<br>
                    This grass is neat and I'm quite unique<br>
                    But I'd like to be, but I'd like to be<br><br>
                    And I hope this is the hardest part<br>
                    We try, we try<br>
                    And when they say they're satisfied<br>
                    They're lying, they're lying<br>
                    Do forgive me, I've seen the treasure's in the bloom<br>
                    But right now, I'm just not strong enough for you<br><br>
                    Sorry, you can see it in my retina<br>
                    Focus in and out, I'm doing better<br>
                    Artificial ghost with no perception<br>
                    I wanna be a Chevy, not a Sentra, uh (yeah, yeah, yeah)<br><br>
                    I don't feel the way they programmed me to feel today<br>
                    Some pieces falling from the waist up<br>
                    I'm so sorry for delays<br>
                    Just need one moment to erase<br>
                    That burning pain before the rage<br>
                    I feel good, I feel good, I feel good (I fixed it)<br><br>
                    And I hope this is the hardest part<br>
                    We try, we try<br>
                    And when they say they're satisfied<br>
                    They're lying, they're lying<br>
                    Do forgive me, I've seen the treasure's in the bloom<br>
                    But right now, I'm just not strong enough for you<br><br>
                    And I hope this is the hardest part<br>
