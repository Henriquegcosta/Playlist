                <p>
                    Past lives couldn't ever hold me down <br>
                    Lost love is sweeter when it's finally found<br>
                    I've got the strangest feeling<br>
                    This isn't our first time around<br>
                    Past lives couldn't ever come between us<br>
                    Some time the dreamers finally wake up<br>
                    Don't wake me I'm not dreaming<br>
                    Don't wake me I'm not dreaming<br><br>
                    All my past lives<br>
                    They've got nothing on me<br>
                    Golden eagle, you're the one and only flying high<br>
                    Through the cities in the sky<br><br>
                    I'll take you way back<br>
                    Countless centuries<br>
                    Don't you remember?<br>
                    That you were meant to be my Queen of Hearts<br>
                    Meant to be my love<br><br>
                    Through all of my lives<br>
                    I never thought I'd wait so long for you<br>
                    The timing is right<br>
                    The stars are aligned<br><br>
                    So save that heart for me<br>
                    Cause girl you know that you're my destiny<br>
                    Swear to the moon, the stars<br>
                    The sons, and the daughters<br>
                    Our love is deeper than the oceans of water<br><br>
                    Hey, I need you now<br>
                    I've waited oh so long yeah<br>
                    Baby love, I need you now<br>
                    I've waited oh so long<br><br>
                    Passing seasons<br>
                    Empty bottles of wine<br>
                    My ancient kingdom came crashing down without you<br>
                    Baby child, I'm lost without your love<br><br>
                    Diamond sparrow, my moonlight majesty<br>
                    You know I need you, come flying back to me<br>
                    Through all of my lives<br>
                    I never thought I'd wait so long for you<br>
                    The timing is right<br>
                    The stars are aligned<br>
                    So save that heart for me<br>
                    Cause girl you know that you're my destiny<br>
                    Swear to the moon, the stars<br>
                    The sons, and the daughters<br>
                    Our love is deeper than the oceans of water<br><br>
                    Hey I need you now<br>

                    Our love is deeper than the oceans of water<br>
                    Hey I need you now<br>
