                    My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I<br>
                    Got out of bed at all<br>
                    The morning rain clouds up my window<br>
                    And I can't see at all<br>
                    And even if I could it'll all be gray<br>
                    But your picture on my wall<br>
                    It reminds me, that it's not so bad<br>
                    It's not so bad<br><br>
                    My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I<br>
                    Got out of bed at all<br>
                    The morning rain clouds up my window (window)<br>
                    And I can't see at all<br>
                    And even if I could it'll all be gray<br>
                    But your picture on my wall<br>
                    It reminds me, that it's not so bad<br>
                    It's not so bad<br><br>
                    Dear Slim, I wrote you but still ain't callin'<br>
                    I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom<br>
                    I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not've got 'em<br>
                    There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'<br>
                    Sometimes I scribble addresses, too sloppy when I jot 'em<br>
                    But anyways, fuck it, what's been up? Man, how's your daughter?<br>
                    My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father<br>
                    If I have a daughter, guess what I'm a call her?<br>
                    I'ma name her Bonnie<br>
                    I read about your Uncle Ronnie too, I'm sorry<br>
                    I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him<br>
                    I know you probably hear this every day, but I'm your biggest fan<br>
                    I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam<br>
                    I got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man<br>
                    I like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was phat<br>
                    Anyways, I hope you get this, man, hit me back<br>
                    Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan<br>
                    This is Stan<br><br>
                    My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I<br>
                    Got out of bed at all<br>
                    The morning rain clouds up my window (window)<br>
                    And I can't see at all<br>
                    And even if I could it'll all be gray<br>
                    But your picture on my wall<br>
                    It reminds me, that it's not so bad<br>
                    It's not so bad<br><br>
                    Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance<br>
                    I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans<br>
                    If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert<br>
                    You didn't have to, but you could've signed an autograph for Matthew<br>
                    That's my little brother, man, he's only six years old<br>
                    We waited in the blistering cold for you<br>
                    For four hours and you just said, "No"<br>
                    That's pretty shitty, man, you're like his fuckin' idol<br>
                    He wants to be just like you, man, he likes you more than I do<br>
                    I ain't that mad though, I just don't like bein' lied to<br>
                    Remember when we met in Denver, you said if I'd write you you would write back<br>
                    See, I'm just like you in a way<br>
                    I never knew my father neither<br>
                    He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her<br>
                    I can relate to what you're saying in your songs<br>
                    So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on<br>
                    'Cause I don't really got shit else, so that shit helps when I'm depressed<br>
                    I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest<br>
                    Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds<br>
                    It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me<br>
                    See, everything you say is real, and I respect you 'cause you tell it<br>
                    My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7<br>
                    But she don't know you like I know you Slim, no one does<br>
                    She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up, you gotta call me, man<br>
                    I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose<br>
                    Sincerely yours, Stan<br>
                    P.S. we should be together too<br><br>
                    My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I<br>
                    Got out of bed at all<br>

                    And I can't see at all<br>
                    And even if I could it'll all be gray<br>
                    But your picture on my wall<br>
                    It reminds me, that it's not so bad<br>
                    It's not so bad<br><br>
                    Dear Mr. I'm Too Good To Call Or Write My Fans<br>
                    This will be the last package I ever send your ass<br>
                    It's been six months and still no word, I don't deserve it?<br>
                    I know you got my last two letters, I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect<br>
                    So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it<br>
                    I'm in the car right now, I'm doing ninety on the freeway<br>
                    Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka<br>
                    You dare me to drive?<br>
                    You know the song by Phil Collins, "In the Air of the Night"<br>
                    About that guy who could have saved that other guy from drowning<br>
                    But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a a show he found him?<br>
                    That's kinda how this is, you could a rescued me from drowning<br>
                    Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy<br>
                    And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call<br>
                    I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall<br>
                    I love you Slim, we coulda been together, think about it<br>
                    You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it<br>
                    And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it<br>
                    I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me<br>
                    See Slim, shut up bitch! I'm tryin' to talk!<br>
                    Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk<br>
                    But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I ain't like you<br>
                    'Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more, and then she'll die too<br>
                    Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now<br>
                    Oh shit, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this shit out?<br><br>
                    My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I<br>
                    Got out of bed at all<br>
                    The morning rain clouds up my window (window)<br>
                    And I can't see at all<br>
                    And even if I could it'll all be gray<br>
                    But your picture on my wall<br>
                    It reminds me, that it's not so bad<br>
                    It's not so bad<br><br>
                    Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy<br>
                    You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?<br>
                    Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that<br>
                    And here's an autograph for your brother<br>
                    I wrote it on the Starter cap<br>
                    I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must've missed you<br>
                    Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you<br>
                    But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?<br>
                    I say that shit just clownin', dawg, come on, how fucked up is you?<br>
                    You got some issues Stan, I think you need some counseling<br>
                    To help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some<br>
                    And what's this shit about us meant to be together?<br>
                    That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other<br>
                    I really think you and your girlfriend need each other<br>
                    Or maybe you just need to treat her better<br>
                    I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time<br>
                    Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine<br>
                    If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you but Stan<br>
                    Why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan<br>
                    I just don't want you to do some crazy shit<br>
                    I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick<br>
                    Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge<br>
                    And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid<br>
                    And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to<br>
                    Come to think about, his name was, it was you<br>
                    Damn!<br>
