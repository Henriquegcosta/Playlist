                <p>
                    I'm going back to 505<br>
                    If it's a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive<br>
                    In my imagination, you're waitin' lyin' on your side<br>
                    With your hands between your thighs<br><br>
                    Stop and wait a sec<br>
                    When you look at me like that, my darlin', what did you expect?<br>
                    I'd probably still adore you with your hands around my neck<br>
                    Or I did last time I checked<br><br>
                    Not shy of a spark<br>
                    The knife twists at the thought that I should fall short of the mark<br>
                    Frightened by the bite, though it's no harsher than the bark<br>
                    The middle of adventure, such a perfect place to start<br><br>
                    I'm going back to 505<br>
                    If it's a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive<br>
                    In my imagination, you're waitin' lyin' on your side<br>
                    With your hands between your thighs<br><br>
                    But I crumble completely when you cry<br>
                    It seems like once again you've had to greet me with goodbye<br>
                    I'm always just about to go and spoil a surprise<br>
                    Take my hands off of your eyes too soon<br><br>
                    I'm going back to 505<br>
                    If it's a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive<br>
                    In my imagination, you're waitin' lyin' on your side<br>
                    With your hands between your thighs and a smile<br>
